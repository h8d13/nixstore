          In general, outputs must be registered as roots separately. However,
          even if the output of a derivation is registered as a root, the
          collector still deletes store paths that are used only at build

          network). To prevent it from doing so, set this option to `true`.

          This options specifies the Unix group containing the Nix build user
          accounts. In multi-user Nix installations, builds should not be
          performed by the Nix account since that would allow users to
          arbitrarily modify the Nix store and database by supplying specially
          crafted builders; and they cannot be performed by the calling user
          since that would allow him/her to influence the build result.

          Therefore, if this option is non-empty and specifies a valid group,
          builds are performed under the user accounts that are a member
          of the group specified here (as listed in `/etc/group`). Those user
          accounts should not be used for any other purpose\!

          Nix never runs two builds under the same user account at the
          same time. This is to prevent an obvious security hole: a malicious
          user writing a Nix expression that modifies the build result of a
          legitimate Nix expression being built by another user. Therefore it
          is good to have as many Nix build user accounts as you can spare.
          (Remember: uids are cheap.)

          The build users should have permission to create files in the Nix
          store, but not delete them. Therefore, `/nix/store` should be owned
          by the Nix account, its group should be the group specified here,
          and its mode should be `1775`.

          If the build users group is empty, builds are performed under
          the uid of the Nix process (that is, the uid of the caller if
          `NIX_REMOTE` is empty, the uid under which the Nix daemon runs if
          `NIX_REMOTE` is `daemon`). Obviously, this should not be used
          with a nix daemon accessible to untrusted clients.
